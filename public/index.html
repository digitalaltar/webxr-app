    <h3>Welcome to first.sequence, an immersive 3D experience showcasing the integration of human creative vision with AI and XR technology.</h3>
    <p>Each element of this project has been designed, coded, generated, and directed by me - <a href="https://digitalaltar.com">Digital Altar</a>. Careful attention has been put into the fusion of AI-generated music and 3D environments, powered by three.js, to create a cohesive and engaging digital experience.</p>
    <p>The 3D experience presented here is available in any modern browser and compatible with many devices, including mobile phones and VR environments.</p>
    <p>This project illustrates the possibilities of AI tools enhancing, rather than replacing, the artist's vision â€” demonstrating the potential when human creativity and ingenuity are combined with technological innovation.</p>
    <p>Interested in creating your own experience? Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/digitalaltar/webxr-app">fork this project</a> on Github. I'd love to know what you make!</p>
